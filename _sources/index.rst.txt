Holistic AI Metrics Library
===========================

We have set out to produce a library of metrics for auditing AI and algorithms. To do so we focus on 5 different verticals that help us in assessing AI risk - that is Bias, Efficacy, Explainability, Privacy and Robustness. For each vertical we have a set of metrics as well as classes to help compute and display these metrics in a simple and seamless way.
